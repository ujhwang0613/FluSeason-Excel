# Preparing For Influenza Season
The Influenza Season Analysis is a portfolio project created in 2022.

The project contains a data analysis of historical medical and population data to help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The final results examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.

### Context
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.
